Machines can perform tasks really fast
we can program machines to do certain things for ous
machines are good at things we tell them to do
eg: if route1> route 2 && route1 >route3 then pick route 1

but how can a machine tell if a person is angry or not
can we tell a machine what a cat is

Machine Learning: programming machines to do things without explicitedly statin them

Big data is stored in NoSql databases like mongoDB, coz they help to store unstructured data unlike SQL

Machine Learning can be divided into:
1. Supervised(labelled data):
    . Classification
    . Regression
2. Unsupervised(unlabelled data):
    .Clustering
    . Association
3.Reinforcement
    .Skill acquisition
    . Real time learning

Machine learning algorithm/model takes in data and predicts future patterns based on the previous data
